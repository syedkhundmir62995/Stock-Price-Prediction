# Stock-Price-Prediction
- Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a long time. While supporters of the efficient market hypothesis believe that it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions demonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may lead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be very accurately predicted. 
- In this project, I used an approach of hybrid modeling for stock price prediction building where in I also clubbed the news headlines data to find whether there was any kind of impact on stock prices due to news headlines.
- I have used AdaBoost and SVM regressor algorithms in model development.
