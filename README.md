# Stock-Price-Prediction
- Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a long time. While supporters of the efficient market hypothesis believe that it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions demonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may lead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be very accurately predicted. 
- In this project, I propose an approach of hybrid modeling for stock price prediction building different machine learning models.
